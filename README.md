# iPv6-Transformer

This Python script implements an IPv6 shortener algorithm using Tkinter for the graphical user interface. It allows users to input an IPv6 address and transforms it by removing the longest consecutive zeros. The transformed IPv6 address is displayed in the GUI along with the original input.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the `script.py` file is located.
5. Run the script by executing the following command:

    ```
    python script.py
    ```

6. The GUI window will open, allowing you to input an IPv6 address and click the "Shorten" button to transform it.
